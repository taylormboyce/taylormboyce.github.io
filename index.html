             Hi! I wanted to take a moment to introduce myself and give some background information as to who I am for those of you that are taking the time to check out my art work. So, let’s jump into it. I am an artist native to Sarasota, Florida (10th generation Floridian, Oh my!). I began with art when I was very young. – I can’t remember a point in time of which I was not dabbling in the art realm. 
<br>
             Although growing up my family did not have a surplus of money, my mother saw artistic potential in me as a toddler and wanted to make sure that I was enrolled in one of the best private art classes in town (expensive). So, my mother talked to the teacher and convinced her not only to make an exception for my young age (5 years old) but, to barter with my parents for their business services (residential painting, go figure!). I am immensely grateful to my parents and that teacher for making it possible for me to attend those classes so early because it truly built the foundation of my artistic capability.
<br>
             As I got older, I went through incredibly inspired phases and dormant phases in regard to creating pieces. To this day, I go back and forth between creating a mass of pieces and making a couple sporadically. Art isn’t something that I think should be forced out. I believe art comes as and when it should to your mind. 
<br>
             Many of my pieces have previously been held in <a href="http://www.studiovgallery.com/welcome.html">Studio V Gallery</a> in Venice, Florida. My piece, <a href="http://taylormboyce.github.io/images/birch1.jpg">Splitting Bark</a>, was published as the contents page in the 2012 July issue of <a href="http://venicemagazineonline.com/">Venice Magazine</a>.
<br>
             I am currently a student at the University of Florida working on my BA in advertising –yes, a citizen of Gator Nation. In addition to my studies, my time is primarily filled up with two and a half jobs and getting to see my friends and family as much as possible. That being said, life can be chaotic and messy. There are literally millions of other things that you could be doing with your time or looking at on the internet and you’re taking time out of your life and browsing to look at my artwork. So, thank you. I hope you enjoy your time here.
